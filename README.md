Cupid (Digital Media)

Cupid is an AI-powered dating platform that combines playful question prompts with intelligent matching. The platform encourages humor and creativity through outrageous questions, while using modern AI techniques to compare answers and find potential matches.

The key distinction of Cupid is that every user participates as both a general user and as a Cupid (matchmaker). Instead of swiping for themselves, users help pair up others on the platform, earning recognition for successful matches.

Overview

Database of all users, profiles, and matches.

AI model to evaluate similarity in user responses to open-ended questions.

Outrageous multiple-choice and open-ended questions generated by AI.

Dashboard where users act as Cupids, choosing whether two profiles are a good match.

Leaderboard ranking Cupids by successful matches and positive feedback.

Core Features
User Onboarding

Sign up as both Cupid and general user.

Provide profile information:

First name

Birthday (age calculation)

Gender identity (inclusive options)

Sexuality

Relationship intent (long-term, short-term, friendship, etc.)

Upload up to six photos

Contact information (phone or email)

Question System

AI generates a set of outrageous, funny, and thought-provoking questions.

Each user receives:

Four multiple-choice questions (categories include food, relationships, compatibility, communication).

One open-ended question selected from three provided options.

Responses are stored in Supabase, with open-ended answers embedded into vectors for similarity comparisons.

Cupid Dashboard

Every user participates as a Cupid (matchmaker).

Dashboard displays two random user profiles side by side.

Each profile card includes:

Profile image

Name and age

Gender and intent

Answers to questions (expandable on click)

Cupids decide: Match or Pass.

Animated “deck of cards” interface with transition effects.

Matching System

Cupids match two profiles for others, not themselves.

AI calculates similarity scores using sentence embeddings.

Matches are stored in a dedicated matches table.

Notifications are triggered for matched users.

Feedback mechanism: matched users can provide a thumbs-up or thumbs-down rating, feeding back into Cupid rankings.

Leaderboard

Ranks Cupids by:

Number of matches created

Positive feedback (thumbs-up)

Overall success rate

AI and Matching

Uses Hugging Face Sentence Transformer all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Residual embeddings subtract question influence for more meaningful comparisons.

Cosine similarity is used as the main similarity metric.

Matchmaking emphasizes medium similarity scores, to avoid pairing users who are either too identical or completely unrelated.
